#### You Might Need To Change Your Execution Policy 
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
### IF you do not have a MonoSpace font installed yet visit: 
### All you have to do to install my Project is just downloading the Repo and running init.bat 
### If You don't have Oh-My-Posh Installed, or haven't even configured your $PROFILE, init.bat will also take care of that!
## If You didn't configure your $PROFILE yourself and it didn't appear in your WindowsPowerShell Folder, just run init.bat again.
# After that everything should work, Restart PowerShell if you had it open and enter "powah"
